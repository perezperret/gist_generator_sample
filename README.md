# GistGenerator Sample

Quick demo for [GistGenerator](https://github.com/perezperret/gist_generator).
I had been itching to try [Vercel](https://vercel.com)'s serverless Ruby functions, so I gave that a try.

See it live [here](https://gist-generator-sample.vercel.app/).

Simply enter the details of the repo to generate a snippet.

Ruby functions are still in early alpha, but if this gets a bit more mature it's going to be fun to write small web apps with this sort of Ruby backends.
